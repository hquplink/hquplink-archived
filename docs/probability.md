## Probability

_TL;DR_:

* P = Number of desired outcomes ÷ Number of possible outcomes.
  * So, to get a `6` when rolling a D6, `P` = `1` ÷ `6`, or `16.7%`.

_Independent_ probabilities are calculated using:

* P<sub>both</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> × P<sub>2</sub>.
  * So to get two `6`s when rolling two dice, `1/6` × `1/6`, or `2.78%`.
